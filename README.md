# Arch Linux Repository.cpkgs - Arch Linux Repository & Tools (TBC)

Arch Linux Version: 2023.03.01

A collection of scripts to make your Arch Linux experience easier.

Also a bunch of packages that should've been included in the repo but aren't,
because. Why would you want to compile anything in your daily driver?!
